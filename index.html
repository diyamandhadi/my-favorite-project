        <h1> My Favorite Hobby <br> Baking/Cooking </h1> <h3>______________________</h3>
        <p> Baking is one of my favorite hobbies. This is because when you put things together, you get something totally different, and you are making it from scratch. You get a masterpeice that you made. It is like giving a gift to yourself since you are making it and you get to enjoy it. You can also learn a lot of things by baking about the different ingredients and soon enought you can create you own inventions.</p>
